# Frozen-Meals-Project

## About this Project
There are a lot of options for microwave meals in the freezer section at your local grocery store, all with a wide-array of buzzwords and varying nutritional information; but which is truly the healthiest? And more importantly, which tastes the best? With an overwhelming number of options in front of them, what is a consumer to choose?

This started as a weird, satircial blog idea and has evolved into an informative platform to consolidate data on this prominent product available in grocery stores everywhere in order to serve consumers as a resource to choose the ideal meal for themselves.

### About the Contributor
Haley Sorenson is a proud alumnus of the Tourism, Hospitality, and Event Management program through the School of Public Health at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. After completing her Bachalors degree, she spent many years working in the food and beverage industry and working in a variety of marketing positions in the business to consumer industries before completing a Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp at the University of Denver in March 2020. Currently, Haley is the Media and Analytics Manager at Intelligent Demand, a top-rated, full-service, business to business marketing agency located in Denver, CO. Day-to-day she manages and optimizes omni-channel marketing campaigns for a variety of clients, continuously analyzing marketing metrics to ensure profitability and quality lead generation for full-funnel growth. Continously seeking personal projects to practice her new coding and visualization skills, Haley decided to accumulate the following data inorder to compile information that seems stark or nonexistent in the data world.

The idea started as a joke in college; "Wouldn't it be funny if there was a satirical blog that taste-tested and rated frozen, single meals like a foodie-influencer?" But after learning how to code in a variety of languages, how to create front-end visualizations, and how to compile and serve a database of information that consumers might find informative, it turned into an opportunity to create a tool that the public might find beneficial to their health and nutrition. Of course, we had to stay true to the original idea and include the satirical blog for humor's sake, but the importance of this data remains. Which of the 100's of single-serving, frozen meals abailable in grocery stores is THE best? Now the idea has come to life with expanded variables and an abundance of aggregate information with the hopes that more people can make data-informed decisions about what products they choose while asking themselves, "What's for dinner tonight?"

### Data Process
Looking at the infinite amount of data available, compiling all of the necessary information was not going to be easy. Starting with a web scraping script using Python's Beautiful Soup, we found common microwave meal brand websites and scraped for nutritional information, ingredient lists, and included any buzzwords that brands may use in marketing campaigns for their products. 

From there, all of the scraped data was compiled into a database to then reference in visualizations tp compare brands, meals, and nutritional information in a truly transparent environment. Plus users can visualize which brands use the most buzzwords, which hold true to their claims, and make their own choices about which meals suit their needs.

### Additional Resources
Additional Resources are included within this project in order to help users draw conclusions about the healthiness of these products vs. standard nutritional guidelines from a variety of sources. Resources from the CDC, health.gov, Mayo Clinic, choosemyplate.org, and the USDA are available on the Resources Tab so users can feel compelled to make sure they are choosing proper dietary options for their personal attributes.
